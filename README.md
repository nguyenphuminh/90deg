# 90deg

90deg is an OISC (one instruction set computer) based on perpendicular vectors, vector dot product, and vector addition.

## Basics

Start off with an nD vector (3D in this case) s(a, b, c) as the original state. Each 90deg command takes up 2n+1 parameters (7 in this case), with the first n params being the coordinates of the a vector, the next n params being the coordinates of the b vector, and the last param being a number d. Calculate dot product of s and a, if it is 0 (perpendicular), jump to the next command, otherwise add b to s and jump to command d. It halts simply when all dot products are 0 (no commands can be run) or enter an infinite loop. Note that all values are unbounded signed integers.

For example, here is how to calculate 3+2:

```
s = (3, 2, 0)

(1, 0, 0) (-1, 0, 1) 1
(0, 1, 0) (0, -1, 1) 0
```

State changes:
```
s = (2, 2, 1)
s = (1, 2, 2)
s = (0, 2, 3)
s = (0, 1, 4)
s = (0, 0, 5)
```

## Turing completeness

This is an equivalent of the Minsky machine, so it should be turing complete.

## VM

This repo also comes with a 90deg vm/interpreter in `90deg.js`. To use it, create another JS file:

```js
const vm = require("./90deg");
// or const vm = require("90deg") if you are using it in another package.

vm.run(
    // s vector
    [ 3n, 2n, 0n ],
    // code
    [
        1n, 0n, 0n, -1n, 0n, 1n, 0n,
        0n, 1n, 0n, 0n, -1n, 1n, 0n
    ],
    // log per state change, default is true
    true
);
```

To make it nD, you can simply increase the dimension of the s vector and the VM will adapt.
